    <h1>Manta Ray</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Manta rays</b> are large rays belonging to the genus <i>Mobula</i> (formerly its own genus Manta).<br>
            The larger species, <i>M. birostris</i>, reaches 7 m (23 ft) in width, while the smaller, <i>M. alfredi</i>,<br>
            reaches 5.5 m (18 ft). Both have triangular pectoral fins, horn-shaped cephalic fins and large,<br>
            forward-facing mouths. They are classified among the Myliobatiformes (stingrays and relatives)<br>
            and are placed in the family Myliobatidae (eagle rays). They have the largest brain-to-body<br>
            ratio of all fish, and can pass the mirror test.<br>
